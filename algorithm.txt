TCA music basics
    universal music rules
        -octave is scientific term
        -each octave is 2* frequency below it
        -musical cultural dichotomy 
            -western music 12 divisions per octave (12 semitones)
            -eastern music (Arab tone system) 24 divisions per octave
            
    western music (midi format - Musical Instrument Digital Interface)
        -semitone is the atomic unit
        -an octave has 12 semitones, music is base 12
        -notes are integers between the audible lowest and highest notes 
        -C is the name of the lowest note
            1 octave ((#)sharp (b)flat)
                0   1       2   3       4  5   6       7   8       9  10      11 
                C  (C# Db)  D  (D# Eb)  E  F  (F# Gb)  G  (G# Ab)  A  (A# Bb) B
        -c(octave 0) = 0
            c1 = 12
            c2 = 24
            etc
        -an interval is a number of semitones (a distance)
        -a triad is a cluster of 3 notes - root, middle, top; (0, and 2 stacked intervals)

bosendofer imperial piano has 8.5 octaves, C0 to C8 + 6, 8 * 12 (semitones per octave) + 6 (semitones)
thats 0 - 102; midi accomodates 0 - 128

in USA practical range for teaching any horn or saxophone might be
    60 - 82  //  arbitrary easy to read in sheet music, easy to play on saxophone

an inversion "voicing" is when the notes of a triad are rearranged with respect to which one is on bottom
-see this as a piano layed out from top to bottom low note at the bottom
    4    top                   *
    3    middle           *    *
    2    root        *    *    * 1st inversion root middle top
    1    top         *    *3nd inversion (top down an octave) root middle
    0    middle      *2nd inversion (middle down an octave) (top down an octave) root 
    
KDB+ - TCA basics (algorithm starts here)  -----------------------------------------------------
    -root is always 0
    -the sum of middle and top intervals must be less than 12 (an octave)

TCA algorithm inputs (reasonable defaults in parens)
    1) starting note (72)       // middle c
    2) a triad (0 4 3)          // major "happy" sounding triad 
    3) count of repeating triads per output line (8)
    4) the (step) size (1 semitone) between succesive triads; up or down at random
    5) high low bounds (60 82)  // any line that goes above or below this range is disqualified

-----------------

TCA: pick N random succesive triads, offset up/down by (step) semitones, don't repeat sequence within an inversion

1) generate the inversion rows 
    3rd inversion   0 1 2
    2nd inversion   1 2 3
    1st inversion   2 3 4

2) possible sequences of a triad within an inversion row (root middle top)
    0 1 2
    0 2 1
    1 0 2
    1 2 0
    2 0 1
    2 1 0

2) generate all triad sequence options
   each inversion row gets indexed with all the possible sequences (18 results)
    pairs...
    0 1 2, 0 1 2           0 1 2, 1 2 3           0 1 2, 2 3 4 
    0 2 1                  0 2 1                  0 2 1
    1 0 2                  1 0 2                  1 0 2 
    1 2 0                  1 2 0                  1 2 0
    2 0 1                  2 0 1                  2 0 1
    2 1 0                  2 1 0                  2 1 0

    now indexed...
    0 1 2                  1 2 3                  2 3 4
    0 2 1                  1 3 2                  2 4 3
    1 0 2                  2 1 3                  3 2 4
    1 2 0                  2 3 1                  3 4 2
    2 0 1                  3 1 2                  4 2 3
