triads e pepe

this talk is about generating midi files containing streams of notes that conform to george garzones triadic 
    play head to have you met miss jones
    play one line that sort of sounds like this

about me
    career
        I've been a developer in nyc for 25 years, smalltalk java, web/javascript and kdb,
        I currently work at kcg doing java, kdb, and web stuff

    jazz
        I moved to NYC from saint louis specifically to be around the best jazz scene in the world
        Normally at this point I'd tell people I'm a saxophone player, but george is here :)

about george
    world renown musician
    faculty at Berklee, New England Conservatory, NYU, Manhattan School of Music, The New School
    historic significant innovater

play on cacio e pepe

    lotsa italian going on with george, he talks with his hands
    george's TCA is about triads, cacio e pepe 3 ingredients
    anything is trivial once it becomes obvious
    deceptively difficult to get just right

what is midi
    musical  instrument digital interface
    it is a way to connect musical devices to control one another with midi messages
        a convenient file format for creating sheet music

what is triadic chromatic approach
    a new system for creating unique jazz improvisation lines, a language

I met george in nyc
    short story
        jules bistro
    became friends

talk about george for a minute
    just starting to be known outside of boston
    stories/pictures, etc, gigs
        short story
            michael brecker

roots of the approach
    late 1990's
    he believes he "found" this concept from listening to coltrane so much
        play a short snippet of coltrane and then george?
    new england conservatory music theory class doing ear training exercises
    george can sing this stuff, nobody else could
    he figured alot of this by ear driving back and forth between nyc and boston

visited him in rome from london where he first told me about an approach he was developing
    connect major triads by 1/2 step don't repeat inversion
    explain music stuff enough to understand things
        12 notes per octave 
        what a triad is, quality of triads, etc..

back in london & the prolog implementation
    george didn't like it
    too much repetition
    I hadn't really grasped the concept well enough yet

a few years go by its now 2015
another trip to rome
    he went to do several clinics about this approach
    he developed the concept further

add other triad types, chromatic exercise
george made some videos

here we are now its been a few years again
    making a book
    time to take another crack at it
    no sonic repetition
        think of an inversion as a single note instrument not from the perspective of 
        chordal instrument
    
you can repeat inversions!
    there are 2 keys to avoiding hearing repetition, inversion and order of the notes played within
    anything is trivial once it becomes ovbious

visualizing the problem
    there three notes in any triad you can start on
    there are 6 possible permutations of these 3 notes
      (pictures here)

OMG moment
    the next triad can be any 18 of any of permutations, just not the previous one
        better than that, don't use any of the previous ones (use draw instead of pick)
 
talk about the code now
    currently 2 small files
    midi.q
        domain values
            notes
            intervals
            triads
        midi function
            takes a list of integers 0-128, creates a simple midi file
                the midi file can be imported into any music notation program
                can be played by most music players, ie: vnc
            create a chromatic scale/major scale
    tca.q 
        logic to create chromatic lines
        create a few lines play them



future things
