    play a few

met george in nyc 
    became friends
        talk about george for a minute
            stories/pictures, etc
visited him in rome first told me about an approach he was developing
    connect triads by 1/2 step don't repeat inversion
    explain music
        12 notes
        what a triad is, quality of triads, etc..

back to london & prolog implementation
    george didn't like it
    too much repetition

a few years go by
another trip to rome

developed the concept
add other triad types, chromatic exercise
george made some videos

a few more years
making a book,
time to take another crack at it
"no repetition"
think of an inversion as a single note instrument not from the perspective of 
chordal instrument
you can repeat inversions!
    there are 2 keys to repetition, inversion and note sequence

first 1995
he believes he "found" this concept from listening to coltrane so much
    play a short snippet of coltrane and then george?
new england conservatory music theory class doing ear training exercises
    major triad with 1/2 in between sing size
george can sing this stuff, nobody else can
he figured alot of this by ear driving back and forth between nyc and boston

second
randomnivity

anything is trivial once it becomes ovbious
